I am currently a postdoctoral fellow working with Prof. <a href="https://www.cns.nyu.edu/~eero/">Eero Simoncelli</a> at the <a href="https://www.simonsfoundation.org/flatiron/">Flatiron Institute</a>. My research interests include visual representation learning, inverse problems, information theory, and generative modeling.

Previously, I completed my Ph.D. in Computer Science at the <a href="https://www.technion.ac.il/">Technion - Israel Institute of Technology</a>, where I worked with Prof. <a href="https://elad.cs.technion.ac.il/">Michael Elad</a> and Prof. <a href="https://tomer.net.technion.ac.il/">Tomer Michaeli</a>. My doctoral research focused on the theoretical and practical aspects of image restoration and compression techniques that rely on generative models.
